# Help Matt Get Home - Shortest Path Demo
This simulation implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from "Matt" to his house through a maze of randomly generated trees.

Before clicking the button to have Matt find his way home, you can toggle the trees on and off to create a custom maze.

You can also choose one of three grid sizes.

# Improvements
- Currently the algorithm will look at all nodes even if the there is clearly no complete path from start node to end node. The algorithm could be improved by stopping the process earlier on a failed attempt.
- Add functionality to reposition start and end nodes.
